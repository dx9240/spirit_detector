# spirit_detector

This is a a creative aid for players of narrative roleplaying games. It can also be used to supplment the activity of thrifting, antiquing, and flea market browsing as a storytelling activity. 

Inspired by 'Ghost Hunting for Dummies', commerical 'ghost hunting' devices, the board games Mysterium and Dixit, interactive fiction and locative narratives, trading card collecting, and tabletop roleplaying games such as Urban Shadows.

TODO

Create object reading agent
 - How could this adapt to the environment? (location, temperature, local landmarks, current date)
 - Implement a psuedo-code style interaction for a more immersive 'device-y' feel
 - Refine the 3 types of supernatural data that the device outputs

 
 Create narrative interpretation agent
 - Takes readings


 Create psychic vision agent
 - Based on a combination of the user's input and generated spirit data, generate a psychic vision 'card' as a final product/collectable for the user to have as a momento and potentially use as part of roleplaying game prompting.


Extended Play
 - Make it possible to input multiple object photos to relate to the same reading
 - Create a folio/grimorie 'scrap book' to collect the narrative vingette produced by the spirit reading and psychic vision card. Allow to user to write in their own feild notes as the investigator.
